# MonoManagement

This project is currently only a proof of concept demo.

Intended to be an expense management application integrated with MonoBank initially and with other potential banks consequentially. 

At it's core it is basically an API reader which processes user's transaction data in a useful way and presents it in a form of text, graphs and user configured notifications.
